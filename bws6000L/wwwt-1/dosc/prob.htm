Operating systems were introduced many decades ago to facilitate computer 
applications to share resources, and provide abstract interfaces to hardware, in 
addition to other administrative functions. The OSs were small, efficient, and 
easier to use as they were supporting small set of applications. Since then, OSs 
have become large, complex, and constantly changing to support a variety of 
computer applications including: home, entertainment, and office. Since last 25 
years, Microsoft has released over 20 major versions of OSs for PCs. Similarly, 
in last ten years, there were over a dozen releases of Linux operating system. 
Latest Microsoft Windows XP consists of 40 million lines of code, and latest 
Linux consists of 30 million lines of code. There are thousands of programming 
bugs when a new OS version is released. There are also many security flaws in 
current OSs, and they constantly find new holes right after they fix the 
existing ones. There is no end in sight for the monstrous growth and complexity 
of OSs in near future.</font></p>

<font size="2" color="#800080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the OS 
gets large, complex, and change periodically, it has a ripple effect on the 
computer applications and their longevity and security.&nbsp; It is a daunting 
problem, and there is no one to address it, as every one takes it for granted to 
cope with the existing OS and its related tools and environments. Due to a 
change in OS, often there is a need to change the whole computer system 
including: hardware, software, and tools, which cost tremendous money and 
resources to industry and also individual customers. This problem manifests into 
rapid obsolescence in information technology, people's skills, and resources. </font></span></p>
